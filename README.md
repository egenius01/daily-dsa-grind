# Daily DSA Grind

Welcome to my daily DSA practice repository. This project tracks my progress as I solve problems and master data structures and algorithms.

## 📊 Weekly Progress

| Week | Focus Area | Status | Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Week 1** | Arrays & Hashing | ✅ Completed | [View Week 1](./Week%201/README.md) |

## 🏁 WEEK 1 SUMMARY: MISSION COMPLETE

You have survived the first week of the **"Senior Engineer"** grind. Let's look at the scoreboard:

### 🧠 DSA (Arrays & Hashing)

| Status | Problem | Key Pattern |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| ✅ | **Contains Duplicate** | Sets |
| ✅ | **Valid Anagram** | Hash Maps / Frequency |
| ✅ | **Two Sum** | The Complement Map |
| ✅ | **Group Anagrams** | Sorting as Key / Tuples |
| ✅ | **Top K Frequent** | Bucket Sort |
| ✅ | **Product Except Self** | Prefix/Suffix Pattern |
| ✅ | **Valid Sudoku** | Grid Mapping `r//3` |
| ✅ | **Longest Sequence** | Set "Start of Chain" Logic |

### 🏗️ System Design (SaaS Architecture)

*   **Multi-Tenancy:** Separating Gyms for data isolation.
*   **Data Modeling:** Implementing Many-to-Many Relationships.
*   **Normalization:** Decoupling Plans from Memberships.
*   **API Security:** Establishing Trust boundaries & REST Structure.

### 📈 Progress Report

> **Status:** You started the week "rusty" and "struggling with logic." You ended the week defining RESTful Architectures and solving Medium DSA problems at 3:00 AM in the dark. 🚀

## 🚀 Goals

- [ ] Solve at least one problem daily.
- [ ] Document time and space complexity for every solution.
- [ ] Review and refactor previous solutions weekly.

*“Consistency is the key to mastery.”*
