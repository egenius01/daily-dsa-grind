1. **What did I learn today?**
   - I learnt about Big (O) Notation and how to calculate it.
   - I also learnt that using set over list to solving this problem was more efficient
   - I also discovered that my one liner solution shich is in my code is the most efficient, because i used an inbuilt function which reduces interpreter overhead since python uses C directly and we all know C is faster than python and python was built on top of C.
2. **Where did I struggle?**
   - I forgot how to add an element to a set, had to look it up.
   - I made typos
   - I used a dictionary for my third solution instead of a set which just took up more memory than it should have and i was busy logging numbers i shouldnt have, that i wasnt going to use
3. **What was the pattern?**
   - Hashing / Set
